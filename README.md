# Chatbot Project
This project is a chatbot that uses natural language processing and machine learning to provide conversational responses to user input. The chatbot is trained on a set of predefined intents and responses, allowing it to understand and respond to a wide range of user queries.

# Installation
To install the necessary packages for this project, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
To start the chatbot, simply run the chatbot.py script in your terminal:

python chatbot.py

The chatbot will prompt you to enter a message, and will respond with the appropriate response based on its training data.

# Training
To train the chatbot on new intents or responses, simply update the intents.json file with your new data, and re-run the chatbot_train.py script to retrain the model. Note that you may need to delete the existing chatbot_model.h5 file before retraining.
